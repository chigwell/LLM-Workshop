1 INTRODUCTION
Multimodal models, capable of processing and integrating information from multiple modalities such as
text and images [1], have emerged as a powerful tool for
comprehensive image understanding [2]. These models
hold the potential to revolutionize various applications,
including image retrieval, content creation, and humancomputer interaction. However, evaluating their ability
to capture fine-grained details and contextual information remains a crucial challenge [3]. This article presents a benchmark for evaluating the performance of different multimodal models in identifying and analyzing
specific aspects of images, such as the main object, additional objects, background, details, dominant colors,
style, and viewpoint. By comparing their performance
across a range of tasks, this research aims to provide insights into the strengths and weaknesses of different
multimodal approaches for fine-grained image analysis.
2. BACKGROUND AND RELATED WORK
Multimodal models in computer vision use the interplay between different modalities, such as text and images, to achieve a more holistic understanding of visual
content [4]. This approach has shown promising results
in various tasks, including image captioning, visual
question answering, and image generation [5]. Recent
advancements in deep learning, particularly the development of transformer-based architectures, have further
accelerated progress in this field. Models like CLIP
(Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training [6]) have
demonstrated the ability to learn robust representations
that capture the semantic relationship between images
and text [7]. However, there is a need for standardized
benchmarks to evaluate the performance of multimodal
models in fine-grained image analysis, as existing
benchmarks often focus on broader tasks without explicitly assessing their ability to capture subtle details and
contextual information [8]. This research addresses this
gap by introducing a benchmark that specifically targets
the analysis of diverse visual features in images, enabling a more comprehensive evaluation of their capabilities.

3.1 DATASET CREATION
The dataset creation process involved generating a
diverse set of image descriptions (prompts) by systematically combining distinct visual aspects. These
